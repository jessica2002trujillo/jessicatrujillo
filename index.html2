<h1>1946-ENIAC</h1>
  <p> The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) was first general-purpose electronic computer. It was first designed to calculate artillery firing tables to be used by the United States Army's. The ENIAC helped troops predict where an artillery shell would hit, allowing them to hit their targets more precisely or evade incoming shells. Later, John Mauchly redesigned it to be a modular computer in 1946 to be composed of individual panels that perform separate functions, and it was the first large-scale computer to run solely on electronic components without any mechanical parts slowing it down. <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/609/electronic-numerical-integrator-and-computer-eniac "></p>

    <h2>1981 IBM’s Personal Computer</h2>
    <p> In August 1981, the International Business Machines (IBM) launched its personal computer. Even though it wasn’t the first PC it became the most popular and started to set the standards for what a PC should be. It had a 40k read-only memory and 16k of user memory which costed $1,565.  Some of the features the IBM PC included were a built-in speaker and the ability to run self-diagnostic checks. It also made use of Microsoft’s MS-DOS 1.0, a 16-bit operating system. Costing $1,565, the IBM 5150 had 40K of read-only memory and 16K of user memory. The IBM was a success and the New York Times claimed, “The speed and extent to which IBM has been successful has surprised many people, including IBM itself”.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/pc25/pc25_birth.html"></P>

      <h3>1984 Apple’s Macintosh</h3>
      <p> In January 1984 Steve Jobs launched the first Macintosh (the Mac). He showcased several capabilities the Macintosh’s had, from its ability to “talk” to a drawing application that was able to produce sophisticated images. It became one of the first widely sold personal computer with a graphical user interface (GUI) and a mouse. Macintosh systems found success in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade. In the early 1990s, Apple introduced the Macintosh LC II and Color Classic which were price-competitive with Wintel machines at the time. The Mac quickly became one of the most popular PC at the time. <a href=" https://www.mac-history.net/top/2011-01-24/the-history-of-the-apple-macintosh "></p>

 <h4>1989 The World’s First Website and Server</h4>
 <p>In 1989, British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee submitted a proposal for an information management system that used hypertext to link documents on different computers that were connected to the Internet at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, near Geneva, Switzerland. By the end of 1990 he had developed the key technologies that are the bedrock of the Web, including Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), for creating Web pages; Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), a set of rules for transferring data across the Web; and Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) A year later, the world’s first website and server went live at CERN. <a href="https://www.history.com/news/the-worlds-first-web-site "></p>

   <h5>2000s Everyone's Connected <h5>
     <p> Today we live in homes that are rapidly transforming into spaces where traditional computers dovetail alongside newer pieces of technology, from smartphones and smart TVs to virtual assistants and tablets. With the click of a button, you can now turn on your lights, lock and open your doors. We can almost do anything and everything we desire with wireless connection. This merging of physical and virtual worlds is known as the internet of things. <a href="https://www.explore-life.com/en/articles/technology-in-the-21st-century "></p>
